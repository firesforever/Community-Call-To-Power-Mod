Version 2 

    New Load screen complete with new compatible maps for CCTP (Huge thanks to Fires)
    New (and if I may say so myself, much improved) Foundry Building icon
	New Tech: Oral Tradition (Writing Prereq). Comes with Shaman Hut building.
	New Building: Shaman Hut gives extra healing to units in City. +1 Gold to Incense and Wine.
	New Tech: Military Training. Reqs Bronze Working and Archery. Iron Working Prereq. Comes with Barracks and Artillery Range. This wasn't "needed" exactly, but it does flesh out the early Military (and the icon is awesome ). This also extends the usage of the Spearman unit.
	New Icon for Publishing House
	New Buiding: Dock, 180h, +1g to all sea tiles. Reqs Sailing. Don't like the icon here at all, so it will hopefully be changed in the near future
	New Woodworking Tech. Composite Bow, Catapult, and Oak reveal moved to this tech, Woodworking needs Military Training.

	Fixed civilopedia entries that weren’t showing for many
	Fixed Economic Freedom (gave 5fo/ 5g instead of 1fo/1g)
	Fixed Traditional Institutions (gave 5fo to farms, fishing boats, and plantations in addition to the production to Stone Works)
	Fixed Lobbyist, Top 1%, and Interest Groups, and State Owed Enterprise giving more than they should (some were 25x what they should have been.)
	Fixed Nationalism and Socialism displays
	Fixed bad Tech Flavors
	Fixed Destroyer line where units were melee but couldn’t melee attack
    Fixed many, many little Database errors so logs will be clearer (Huge thanks to Horem)
    Fixed Tin Monopoly (should be +10g, not science)
	Fixed bad text strings on Great Monuments and Raw Materials Techs
	Fixed Old Money giving 50g instead of 10g
	Fixed some text strings

	Optics moved to Classical. Lighthouse cost 300h, Great Lighthouse cost 540. Galileo moved to Physics (I know, doesn’t make much sense). Prereq to Compass and Rudder
	Rudder reqs Division of labor
	Hagia Sophia no longer gives Great Artist (still gives Great Prophet though)
	Polder moved to Trade Fairs (from Guilds). Base improvement is 4f, 1g (from 4f)
	Polder gains +1f from Penicilin and 1g from Coorporations
    Truffles bonus moved to Circus and is +1g.
    Diplo Marriage cost 2500g (instead of 500g)
    City State gold gifts give 25, 50, and 105 influence for gifts of 500g, 1000g, or 2000g (instead of other values which were higher)
    Tile Improvement for CS is 400g (was 200g)
    Railroads don’t give production bonus (from 25%). This one might be a little controversial, so it's not set in stone. I just figured that the movement bonus is enough (just connect the main road) and that production is already high enough as is.

	Workshop moved to Construction (from Division of Labor)
	Artillery Range moved to Archery (from Ballistics). Cost 100h, 2 maintenance (from 340h, 3 maint)
